# Next.js Advanced Features

## 1. App Router Organization
- Place route segments under `src/app` for each major section (products, cart, profile, admin, etc.).
- Use shared layouts with Tailwind-based navbars and footers for consistent branding.

## 2. Server Actions
- Handle logic for orders, subscriptions, or user profile updates on the server side when possible.
- Reduce client overhead and ensure better security/performance.

## 3. React Server Components
- Fetch product data, user info, and subscription details in server components to enhance SEO and reduce client-side complexity.
- Keep interactive elements as client components to leverage Framer Motion animations.

## 4. Performance Optimization
- Implement caching, incremental static regeneration (ISR), or SSR for dynamic pages if beneficial.
- Minimize JS bundle sizes by code-splitting or lazy-loading non-critical features.

## 5. Edge & API Routes
- If real-time shipping or geolocation is needed, consider deploying certain route handlers to Edge Functions.
