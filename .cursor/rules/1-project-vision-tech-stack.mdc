# Odin Chocolate - Next.js Project Vision & Tech Stack

## Vision & Goals
- Build a production-ready Next.js website for Odin Chocolate with a massive “WOW!” factor in design and user experience.
- Utilize Next.js’ latest features (App Router, Server Actions, React Server Components) for performance and developer efficiency.
- Deliver a fluid eCommerce experience: product browsing, subscriptions, and minimal friction checkout.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (latest version) with TypeScript
- Appwrite for database, authentication, storage, and serverless functions
- Modern CSS solution (CSS Modules, Tailwind, Styled Components, etc.)
- Deployment on a suitable SSR-friendly platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS)

## Core Principles
1. **Scalable Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns and easy maintainability.
2. **Performance First**: Fast load times, optimized images, and SSR for SEO benefits.
3. **Norse-Inspired Theme**: Incorporate subtle runic or Viking motifs to reinforce the brand.
4. **Minimal Manual Tweaks**: Code should be production-grade from the start.
