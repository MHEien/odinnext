# UI/UX & Theming

## 1. Brand Identity & Aesthetics
- Norse-inspired color palette: deep browns, gold/bronze accents, and charcoal.
- Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling to maintain consistency across components.
- Runic or Viking motifs as subtle background patterns or accent dividers.

## 2. Layout & Responsiveness
- Flexible grid or flex layouts for product listings and user sections, easily adjustable with Tailwind breakpoints.
- Ensure a fluid design from mobile to large desktop, with adequate spacing and a premium, uncluttered feel.

## 3. Animations & Micro-Interactions
- Use **Framer Motion** from `motion/react` for:
  - Hover states (slight scale, subtle shadow).
  - Page transitions (fade, slide, or advanced parallax).
  - Hero or product image reveal animations (staggered fade-in).
- Keep animations smooth (60+ FPS) to reinforce a luxury experience.

## 4. Accessibility
- Ensure all tailwind classes still allow good contrast, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.
- Support dynamic text scaling without breaking layouts.

## 5. Polished & Premium Feel
- Hero sections with large banners, possibly parallax motion on scroll.
- Encourage minimal but impactful animations that express the brand story, not just flashiness.
- Maintain consistent typography, spacing, and color usage across the entire site.
