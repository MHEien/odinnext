# Admin Dashboard for Odin Chocolate

## 1. Admin Scope
- Provide a secure interface for admin users to manage products, orders, subscriptions, and user info.
- Enforce an "admin" role check with Appwrite or a similar approach to restrict access.

## 2. Dashboard Layout
- Use Tailwind for a clean, data-centric UI. 
- Incorporate Framer Motion for subtle animations on menu toggles, table expansions, or chart reveals.

## 3. Core Management Features
- **Product Management**: Create, edit, delete products, update stock, upload images.
- **Order Management**: View orders, update statuses, track shipments, process refunds.
- **Subscriptions**: Oversee active subscriptions, adjust frequencies, handle cancellations.
- **User Management**: Search/filter user accounts, view their orders/subscriptions.

## 4. Data Visualization & Insights
- Real-time or near-real-time stats on total sales, subscription trends, best-selling chocolates.
- Graphs/charts with tailwind-based styling and motion-based animations for a premium effect.

## 5. Productivity & Alerts
- Implement bulk actions for repetitive tasks (e.g., updating multiple orders).
- Show notifications/alerts for urgent issues (e.g., out-of-stock products, shipping delays).
- Keep interactions smooth and user-friendly to maintain the brand’s “WOW” standard.

## 6. Security & Audit
- Log critical admin actions (price changes, cancellations, refunds) for audit trails.
- Make sure no non-admin route or page is accessible to standard users.
